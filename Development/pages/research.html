		<p>This research page showcases the ideas and inspiration taken from different websites and how they were incorporated into this website. In order to develop this site, references were drawn from a variety of good websites. So, this page is dedicated to displaying and contrasting the components used on our website against the website that is investigated for research purposes.<br>
		<br>
		The first reference taken is from a book blog website created by Sarah S. Davis called <a href="https://brokebybooks.com/welcome-to-broke-by-books/" target="blank"><font style="color:#ff523b;">Broke By Books</font></a> and it is relatively simple. On the home page of the website, a big and bold welcome message is displayed which has a good first impression. It gives a warm and welcoming feeling and so it was implemented in our website.<br>
		<br>
		As show in the images, a similar message is displayed on our website but, it contrasts from the reference website as custom font is used and the font colors used are according to the color pallet of our website.</p>

	<!--------------------Website 2-------------------->
 	<h2>Website 2: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/genres/fiction" target="blank">Goodreads</a></h2>

	<div class="discription">
		<p>Here reference taken is from <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/" target="blank"><font style="color:#ff523b;">Goodreads</font></a>. It is the worldâ€™s largest site for readers and book recommendations. The footer of this website contains links to their social media platforms, links to different pages, download links for their app and copyright message. So, it seemed to be an important element of the website and thus was implement on our website.<br>
		<br>
		In the images shown above the footers of both websites are highlighted in a red rectangular box. As shown above, as our project is relatively simpler and smaller, our footer contains list of our social media platforms, app download images and the logo and slogan of our book store in the center along with a copyright message at the bottom. "hr" tag is used to create a separating line for the copyright message at the bottom.</p>

		<p>The reference taken is from <a href="https://booksmandala.com/" target="blank"><font style="color:#ff523b;">Booksmandal's</font></a> website. <a href="https://booksmandala.com/" target="blank"><font style="color:#ff523b;">Booksmandal</font></a> is an online bookstore that also has a physical store in Pokhara, Nepal. This website has an image slider on the top section of the home page that shows attractive offers on different new books and old books. The image slider also has a previous and next button which help to navigation between the images.<br>
		<br>
		In the image shown on the left hand side, the image slider of the reference website is highlighted in a red rectangular box. In the image shown in the right hand side, the image slider of our website is displayed. In our website, the image slider is used to display the genres of books displayed in the products page. We can go to the desired genre just by clicking on the image of the respective genre. Instead of the previous and next button, radio buttons have been used for each image in the slider so that we can navigated to any image at once. This was done using JavaScript and CSS.</p>

		<p>The reference taken is from <a href="https://www.fcbarcelona.com/en/" target="blank"><font style="color:#ff523b;">Fcbarcelona's</font></a> website. <a href="https://www.fcbarcelona.com/en/" target="blank"><font style="color:#ff523b;">Fcbarcelona</font></a> is a very famous football club situated in the city of Barcelona. On their website, they have used hover effect in various places to make the website more interactive and attractive. In the "Only For Culers" section of the home page the categories pop up as we hover over them with our cursor. This caught my eye as it seemed interactive and in a way improved the user experience.<br>
		<br>
		In the image shown on the left hand side, the hover effect of the reference website can be seen and it creates an effect of enlarging the image as we hover over it. In the image shown on the right hand side, the hover effect used in the products page of our website is shown. In our website, the hover effect moves the image of the book 10 pixels upwards as we hover our cursor over it. This was done using the ":hover" selector in CSS.</p>
