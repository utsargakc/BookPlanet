	<h1 class="title">Technology and its influence in daily life</h1>
	<div class="discription">
		<!-------Introduction to the blog------------->
		<p>Technology has increasingly been a part of our daily lives over the last two to three decades, to the point that it has taken over our lives. When we take a break from what we are doing and take a look around. What do we  notice?  Technology, gadgets, laptops, or video surveillance everywhere around us. The presence of technology on our lives and in our surroundings is unavoidable. But, the impact that technology has in our lives can be positive or negative depending on a vast number of factors.<br>
		<br>
		In this blog, we are going to take a look at various aspects and feats of technology and how they have affected my life and lives of people in general.<br>
		<br>
		<!-------Positive impacts of tech------------->
		<font style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Positive Impacts of Technology</font><br>
		<br><div class="image"><img src="../images/positive.jpg"></div><br>
		As a student, technology has had many positive impacts in my life. In today's time any information that I want is just a few clicks away. The availability of online courses enables students like me to be able to gain knowledge while staying at home or anywhere in the world. Online classes helped me continue my studies in adverse conditions like the recent pandemic.<br>
		<br>
		Everyday activities like cooking, eating, cleaning, entertainment, etc. have been made so easy by home appliances that are getting smarter every day. Transportation is way better than it was a few decades ago and with the popularization of EVs and newer public transportation technologies like hyper loop are under development the future of transport is promising to be more efficient and greener.<br>
		<br>
		Technology has huge potential to improve current health and healthcare systems. From AI-powered clinical drug trials to enabling preventative patient monitoring to wellness solutions such as wearables, the possibilities are endless. During the pandemic, we've seen technology fill in the gaps in healthcare. Telemedicine apps are the first step toward ensuring that healthcare is more fair and accessible to everyone, regardless of socioeconomic status. I also benefited for the medical advancements brought by technology as the vaccine for COVID19 was made available through technology. 
		<br>
		Cell phones were largely used for calling and sending texts just over a decade ago. Cell phones are being used for a wide range of purposes. Phones can do anything from take high-resolution photos to view pixel-perfect videos, browse the internet, play graphic-intensive games, and even track your activities. It's incredible how this small device can do difficult duties while also meeting basic communication requirements.<br>
		<br>
		The introduction of smartphones has greatly simplified our lives. Through video conversations and instant messaging services, people may now communicate with their loved ones more regularly and effortlessly. Producing slides, reading emails, and creating documents no longer require the use of a computer.<br>
		<br>
		In a nutshell, smartphones and applications have transformed the way we work, interact, and entertain ourselves. Furthermore, the rapid proliferation of smartphones is directly linked to the growing expansion of e-commerce and internet-based businesses.
		</p><br>
		<!-------Negative impacts of tech------------->
		<font style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Negative Impacts of Technology</font><br>
		<br><div class="image"><img src="../images/negative.jpg"></div><br>
		The most obvious negative impacts of technology can be seen in our environment. When dangerous or excessive amounts of gases such as carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitric oxide, and methane are injected into the earth's atmosphere, it is known as air pollution. The main sources all deal with technology that came after the industrial revolution, such as fossil fuel combustion, factories, power plants, mass agriculture, and automobiles. Air pollution has detrimental health effects on humans and animals, as well as contributing to global warming, as rising levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere trap thermal energy in the Earth's atmosphere, causing the global temperature to rise.<br>
		<br>
		Water pollution, on the other hand, is the contamination of bodies of water such as lakes, rivers, seas, and groundwater as a result of human activity. Domestic trash, industrial effluents, and insecticides and pesticides are among the most frequent water contaminants. The release of improperly treated wastewater into natural water bodies, for example, can lead to the destruction of aquatic ecosystems. Other negative consequences include infections like typhoid and cholera, eutrophication, and ecosystem damage, all of which have a severe impact on the food chain.<br>
		<br>
		Another detrimental consequence of technology on the environment is resource depletion. It occurs when a resource is depleted quicker than it can be replaced. Natural resources are those that exist in the world without being created by humans, and they can be renewable or non-renewable. Aquifer depletion, deforestation, mining for fossil fuels and minerals, pollution of resources, soil erosion, and overconsumption of resources are the most severe forms of resource depletion. Agriculture, mining, water use, and fossil fuel consumption are the key causes, all of which have been made possible by technological improvements.<br>
		<br>
		The over-dependence on smartphones is partly to blame for our sedentary lifestyle and lack of physical activity. This is especially true for the younger generation, who are addicted to their phones at all times. Cell phone addiction has a severe impact on our lives in the present era. To deal with this problem effectively, caution is required.<br>
		<br>
		I personally have experienced such laziness as I used to spend a lot of my time on social media and on my phone playing games for the most of my day. Being on my phones screen for more than 10 hours everyday made my eyes hurt sometimes. These habits also have any impact on a person's mental health and social life.<br>
		<br>
		The way people's lives seem to be perfect on social media can also result in feeling unconfident and incomplete.Numerous studies showed that social media exposure might lead to a prolonged feeling of loneliness and detachment.<br>
		<br>
		Moreover, not having to walk for long distances due to means of transport has also impacted my fitness and stamina. <br>
		<br>
		<font style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">What should we do?</font><br>
		<br>
		Technology ultimately changed the world as we know it, accelerating progress in many sectors and increasing equality and opportunity for all people, regardless of their socioeconomic status.<br>
		<br>
		Misuse of technology is to blame for the majority of the damage. The social media example above demonstrates the need for greater empathy and accountability for users while developing technological goods. It's time to start talking about how better technology can protect us from distraction, reinforce meaningful interactions, and not encourage addictive behavior by affecting the subconscious mind.<br>
		<br>
		Along with these efforts, we need to be more responsible towards our environment. And, sustainability should be our main priority while building new tech and infrastructures.
